Industry has adopted controlled experiments for software and product development purposes. Microsoft's Bing development team alone, runs over 10,000 experiments a year. Startups that endorse controlled experiments tend to outperform those that do not. 

However, establishing a successful experimentation practice in a company requires implementing a computationally powerful platform that combines the best of science and engineering. Scientific methods in particular, amid "big-data" have to overcome the data-rich and information poor regime, as well as ensure inference validity regardless of the business and engineering constraints. 

In this tutorial, the **participants will familiarize with the inference techniques that have been developed to tackle these causal inference challenges**. Participants will get hands-on experience, applying techniques at the intersection of causal inference and machine learning. This tutorial will provide ECML PKDD participants with thorough, in-depth, and hands-on experience with causal inference and machine learning techniques used and developed in industry and academia - stimulating further scientific advancements and collaboration in the community.
